UPDATE:
- checker funcs now also works for neg numbers
- perfect pivot works -> NOPE
- pivot doesn't work! ->    somehow but stuff into array, sort in
                            and find middle
->> pivot works now hehe
- no leaks anymore
- very first mid algo works -> stack_b kinda wrong order
    -> doesnt matter i guess
- again no leaks :)

NEXT:
- implement chunk last -> fugging seg fault right now
- implement chunk list
- implement first mid point sort to recurs repetition
- hardcode case 3 and 5 nums
